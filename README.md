### Rebasing Main on Your Branch

1. On your branch, execute:
   ```bash
   git rebase -i HEAD~4
   ```
   Replace `4` with the number of commits you have on your branch.

2. When the text editor opens, press `i` to enter insert mode. 

3. Leave `pick` for the first commit message and change `pick` to `s` for all subsequent commit messages.

4. Once you have made the changes, press `Esc`, then type `:wq` and hit `Enter` to save and exit.

5. In the next text file that opens, press `i` and prepend `#` to the start of all commit messages except for the first one.

6. After you've made these changes, press `Esc`, then type `:wq` and hit `Enter` to save and exit.

7. Push your changes with:
   ```bash
   git push origin my-branch-name --no-verify --force
   ```

8. Switch to the main branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   ```

9. Update your local main branch:
   ```bash
   git pull
   ```

10. Switch back to your branch:
    ```bash
    git checkout my-branch-name
    ```

11. Rebase your branch onto main:
    ```bash
    git rebase main
    ```

12. Resolve any merge conflicts using VSCode's merge editor, and click "Complete Merge" after each change.

13. Continue the rebase process:
    ```bash
    git rebase --continue
    ```

Youâ€™re all set!
